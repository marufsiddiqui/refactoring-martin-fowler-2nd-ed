### Chapter 1.1

- When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in a convenient way, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.
- Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking.
- The essence of the refactoring process: small changes and testing after each change. Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so if you make a mistake, it is easy to find where the bug is.
